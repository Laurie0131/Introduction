# Introduction

Welcome to the Universal Payload project. The goal of this project is to define an interface between a first stage platform initialization bootloader and a second stage payload.

## Specification
 
The interface specification is at 
`https://universalpayload.github.io/documentation/`

The specification source is maintained in restructured text format and is available at 
`https://github.com/universalpayload/documentation`

## Sandboxes

A few example implementations of the Universal Payload specification are available.

### UEFI Payload

An implementation of UEFI Payload using EDKII is available as a branch in a mirrored EDK2 repository
`https://github.com/universalpayload/edk2/tree/universal_payload`

### Slim Bootloader

An implementation of Slim Bootloader implementing the Universal Payload specification is available as a branch in a mirrored SBL repository
